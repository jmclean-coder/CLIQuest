Users can have multiple Heros, which are persisted across games.

Randomly generated quests.
Hero death chance.

# Instructions
1. Fork and clone down this rep. 
2. Check out the gemfile and run 'bundle install' if you need
3. Inside the lib/folder you will find another folder with class models and the model for the CLI-App itself.The classes and their relationships are required for the game appropriately. It is reccommended that you don't alter these files. If anything breaks, you can also clone down again.
4. Check out the db folder. Inside db/seeds.rb is where most of the auto-generated data comes from. Feel free to custom write or generate your own data
5. Gem install Rake
6. Run rake db:create to create a new game database.
7. Run rake db:seed to seed your database with data
8. In your command line, type your path to the runner file in the bin folder and have fun!
